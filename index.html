    <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Connie Too ‚Äî a computer science and business student in my final semester at Northeastern University.

        The idea for C2Decoded began during my internship in New York, where I was working in AI transformation and spending hours learning from more than thirty experts across the field. Those conversations made me realize how much curiosity there is around AI, and how often the topic feels inaccessible to people who aren‚Äôt ‚Äúin tech.‚Äù
        
        But my path here wasn‚Äôt linear. I entered college undeclared, unsure of what I wanted to do, and terrified of public speaking. Step by step, I built confidence ‚Äî through hackathons (we placed 7th once and won $5K üòä), mentors who challenged me, and opportunities that showed me technology can be both analytical and deeply human.
        
        From building data fluency programs in private equity to helping organizations navigate AI transformation in communications, I‚Äôve seen firsthand how rapidly technology is reshaping the way we work and live.
        
        I created C2 Decoded to bridge that gap ‚Äî to translate complex ideas about AI and the future of work into conversations that are approachable, relevant, and empowering.
        
        My goal is simple: to help people stay future-fluent in a world where learning never stops.</p>
